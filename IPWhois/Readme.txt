# OSINT IP Lookup Tool v1.00

## Description
PyWho is an **Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) IP Lookup Tool** that gathers intelligence on an IP address using multiple sources, including **WHOIS, GeoIP, Shodan, and AbuseIPDB**. It provides details such as:
- **ASN, Subnet, and Country** (WHOIS Lookup)
- **ISP and Location Information** (GeoIP Lookup)
- **Open Ports and Services** (Shodan Lookup)
- **Malicious Reports and Reputation** (AbuseIPDB Lookup)

This tool is useful for cybersecurity professionals, SOC analysts, incident responders, penetration testers, and network engineers.

## Based Features
âœ… **WHOIS Lookup** â€“ Retrieves ASN, subnet, country, and organization details.
âœ… **GeoIP Lookup** â€“ Fetches ISP, country, region, city, and organization.
âœ… **Shodan Lookup** â€“ Checks open ports, services, hostnames, and ISP information.
âœ… **AbuseIPDB Lookup** â€“ Identifies reported malicious activities associated with the IP.
âœ… **Cross-Platform Compatibility** â€“ Runs on Windows, Linux, and macOS.
âœ… **Lightweight and Fast** â€“ No heavy dependencies.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have **Python 3.x** installed on your system.

### Install Required Packages
```bash
pip install requests ipwhois
```

## Usage
Run the tool with an IP address as an argument:
```bash
python pywho.py <IP_ADDRESS>
```
Example:
```bash
python pywho.py 8.8.8.8
```

### API Key Setup
To use **Shodan** and **AbuseIPDB**, you must obtain API keys and set them in the script:
- **Shodan API Key:** Get it from [Shodan](https://www.shodan.io/)
- **AbuseIPDB API Key:** Get it from [AbuseIPDB](https://www.abuseipdb.com/)

Replace these values in the script:
```python
SHODAN_API_KEY = "your_shodan_api_key"
ABUSEIPDB_API_KEY = "your_abuseipdb_api_key"
```

## Output Example
### WHOIS Information
